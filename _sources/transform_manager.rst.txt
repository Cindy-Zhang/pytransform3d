Managing Transformations
========================

It is sometimes very difficult to have an overview of all the transformations
that are required to calculate another transformation. Suppose you have
a robot with a camera that can observe the robot's end-effector and an object
that we want to manipulate. We would like to know the position of the
end-effector in the object's frame so that we can control it. The
:class:`~pytransform3d.transform_manager.TransformManager` can handle this
for you.

.. plot:: ../../examples/plots/plot_transform_manager.py
    :include-source:

We can also export the underlying graph structure as a PNG with

.. code-block::

    tm.write_png(filename)

.. image:: _static/graph.png
    :width: 50%
    :align: center


A subclass of :class:`~pytransform3d.transform_manager.TransformManager` is
:class:`~pytransform3d.urdf.UrdfTransformManager` which can load robot
definitions from `URDF <http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials>`_ files.
The same class can be used to display collision objects or visuals from URDF
files. The library `trimesh <https://trimsh.org/>`_ will be used to load
meshes. Here is a simple example with one visual that is used for two links:

.. plot:: ../../examples/plots/plot_urdf_with_meshes.py
    :include-source:
