pytransform3d
=============

pytransform3d covers the following groups of transformations.

+-------+--------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Group | Description        | Representations                         |
+=======+====================+=========================================+
| SO(3) | 3D rotations       | unit quaternion, rotation matrix,       |
|       |                    | axis-angle, Euler angles                |
+-------+--------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| SE(3) | 3D transformations | transformation matrix, translation      |
|       | (rotation and      | and unit quaternion, exponential        |
|       | translation)       | coordinates, logarithm of               |
|       |                    | transformation                          |
